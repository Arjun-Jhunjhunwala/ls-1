            Minecraft is a sandbox video game developed by Mojang Studios. The
            game allows players to explore a blocky, procedurally-generated 3D
            world, discovering and extracting raw materials, crafting tools and
            items, and building structures or earthworks. Depending on the game
            mode, players can also fight computer-controlled 'mobs', as well as
            cooperate with or compete against other players in the same world.

          <p>
            Minecraft was created by Markus 'Notch' Persson and released as a
            public alpha for PC on May 17, 2009, before officially releasing on
            November 18, 2011. Since then, it has become one of the best-selling
            video games of all time, available on multiple platforms including
            PC, consoles, and mobile devices. Mojang, the developer, was
            acquired by Microsoft in 2014.
